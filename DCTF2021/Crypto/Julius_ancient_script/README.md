### Writeup
We are given a `flag.txt` that contains `rq7t{7vH_rFH_vI6_pHH1_qI67}`. If you just google `Julius`, you see it is `Caesar`. So we used [caesar-cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher) decoder with `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789` alphabet. Here is the flag:  
```
dcTf{Th3_d13_h4S_b33N_c4ST}
```
