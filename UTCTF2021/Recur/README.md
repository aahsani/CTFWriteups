## Recur

### Challenge Description
I found this binary that is supposed to print flags.  
It doesn't seem to work properly though...  

### Writeup
We are given a binary file that has a function named `recurrence`. This is a recursive function so it takes a lot of time to calculate the result. So we have to implement this function with dynamic programming to get the result fast.  
You can see the script in `main.py` file.  
the flag is:  
```
utflag{0pt1m1z3_ur_c0d3_l0l}
```
