### Challenge Description

The archaeological team at Ã¥ngstromCTF has uncovered an archive from over 100 years ago! Can you read the contents?

### Writeup

We are given a `.tar.gz` file. If we extract the content using 7z, we get another `tar` file which has a `flag.txt` file.  
Here is the flag:
